# Learning-calendar-public
This is public version of my private project Learning Calendar. I dont want to share it's code to everyone, but if you want to join me, write me in telegram @Matveus26.

## What is it?
is an app that helps users study effectively using the spaced repetition system. It syncs with your notes folder on your device and uses artificial intelligence to generate questions and tasks on the topics being studied. After completing the tasks, the app analyzes the user's answers and provides feedback on the quality of the material assimilation.

▎Main Features
